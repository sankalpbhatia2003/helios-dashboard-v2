statement,Dan
And we don't anticipate right now a return to the COVID mortality that we saw in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty one or the first quarter of twenty twenty two.,1.9052359
Because of the primarily because of the very adverse COVID mortality experience earlier in twenty twenty two.,
But having just hit the threshold again I'm not sure we're ready yet to raise the threshold at this point.,1.86949431
Of course we just went back over the seven percent threshold on a trailing twelve month basis.,
So a great question.,
So we've just gotten above that metric again.,0.69617226
We're obviously pleased to be there.,-1.01688542
