tonal_data_explanation = """Hi there! A Tonal Sentiment score is a way to measure how a person's voice sounds when they're speaking, and whether it sounds positive, negative, or neutral.
When we communicate with other people, we use both our words and our tone of voice to convey meaning. Sometimes we might say something that sounds nice, but if our tone of voice is angry or sarcastic, the person we're talking to might think we're actually being mean.
That's why it's important to measure both the tone of voice and the text sentiment together. If we only look at the words someone is saying, we might miss important clues about how they're really feeling. But if we also pay attention to their tone of voice, we can get a better sense of their emotions and intentions.
For example, imagine your friend says "I'm fine" when you ask them how they're doing. If they say it with a cheerful tone of voice, you might think they're actually doing great. But if they say it with a sad or angry tone of voice, you might realize that they're actually not doing so well.
So, by measuring both the tone of voice and the text sentiment together, we can better understand what someone is really trying to say."""

emotion_classifier = """The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Speech Emotion Classifier model was built to classify emotions from audio files. The model is trained on the RAVDESS dataset, "The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song" by Livingstone & Russo, which is licensed under CC BY-NA-SC 4.0. RAVDESS contains 7,356 files that includes 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a North American accent.
The purpose of this model is to classify emotions majorly into 8 emotions: neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust with a current accuracy of 64% The model also includes the classification of the speakers’ gender. This machine learning model was developed to accompany and enhance the insights generated from Helios’ Tonal Sentiment Data. """
